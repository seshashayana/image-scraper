# image-scraper

Hello, Welcome to Image Scraper!

This is a simple scraping tool, which searches for a key word from "www.google.com" and downloads the images from the search results.

Two python files are created in this folder:
1. scraper.py (scraper.py file is for linux or mac machine)
2. scraper_windows_pc.py (scraper_windows_pc.py file is for windows machine)

The execution is same in both files. Only the file extensions for the webdrivers are mentioned in windows code but for linux and mac machines drivers do not have any extensions.
